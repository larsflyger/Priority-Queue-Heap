PROJECT TITLE: Priority Queue Heap
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Implements a priority queue using a heap data structure. The test class creates a menu that allows the user to generate a random integer value between 1 and 100 and enqueue it, dequeue the highest priority element and print it, or print all the items in the queue.
VERSION or DATE: 4/29/2013
AUTHORS: Lars Flyger
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Once the package is compiled, run the PriorityTest.java file. The program will create a text-based user interface that allows the user to queue or dequeue from the heap.
